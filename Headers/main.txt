what is headers?
HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information 
with an HTTP request or response. An HTTP header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon ( : ),
then by its value. Whitespace before the value is ignored.

In other words:
let's a person want to sent a mail through post office
then we put the mail data inside the envelop and inside the envelop
we have the actual data and upper side of the envelop we have the information 
which is called the sender infor and in http is called the headers

HTTP headers are an important part of the API request and response
as they represent the meta-data associated with API request and response.

-> Headers carry information for the request and response Body.
