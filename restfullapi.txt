it is diferent from simple api because it is totally based on standard rules and best practices to use.

let say we have a server and a computer which is a client
-> client request something from server and get response from server
=> all these things happening by some standard rules which we can say as a restfullapi.

It works on:
1. Server client architecture
2. always respect all http methods
=> GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE
--------------------------------------------
GET /user -> users data read and return data
POST /user -> handle a new user
PUT /user -> put something like upload a user image
PATCH /user -> update the user
DELETE /user -> delete the user
--------------------------------------------



=> Server side render which is SSR is that
 like when a client request a html page and
 server have that file and it renders frequently in no time which is SSR.
